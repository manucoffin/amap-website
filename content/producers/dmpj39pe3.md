biography: >-
  I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you
  right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. You gotta think
  like a tree. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But
  sometimes I put even numbersâ€”just to upset the critics. You create the dream -
  then you bring it into your world. There comes a nice little fluffer. We'll
  make some happy little bushes here.


  Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Sometimes you learn more from your mistakes than you do from your masterpieces.


  Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Let's have a nice tree right here. In this world, everything can be happy. Give him a friend, we forget the trees get lonely too. Every highlight needs it's own personal shadow.


  Let's put a touch more of the magic here. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care. We need dark in order to show light. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. What the devil.
