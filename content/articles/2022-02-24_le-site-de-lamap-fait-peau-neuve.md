Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. **This is unplanned it really just happens**. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world!

> How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. We'll do another happy little painting. Anything you want to do you can do here. Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things.

Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. Almost everything is going to happen for you automatically - you don't have to spend any time working or worrying. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts. By now you should be quite happy about what's happening here. If there's two big trees invariably sooner or later there's gonna be a little tree.

Let your heart be your guide. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. You want your tree to have some character. Make it special. This is the way you take out your flustrations.

Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. Let's build an almighty mountain. Only eight colors that you need. They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. Let that brush dance around there and play.

We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. And right there you got an almighty cloud. What the devil. Little trees and bushes grow however makes them happy.

I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Don't hurry. Take your time and enjoy. We tell people sometimes: we're like drug dealers, come into town and get everybody absolutely addicted to painting. It doesn't take much to get you addicted. We want to use a lot pressure while using no pressure at all. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at?
