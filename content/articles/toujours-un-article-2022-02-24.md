This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. How do you make a round circle with a square knife? That's your challenge for the day. Let's do it again then, what the heck.

The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. Just let go - and fall like a little waterfall. Just let these leaves jump off the brush

It's life. It's interesting. It's fun. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. Let's build some happy little clouds up here. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it.

I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Let your heart be your guide. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. We have no limits to our world. We're only limited by our imagination.

That is when you can experience true joy, when you have no fear. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Don't be afraid to make these big decisions. Once you start, they sort of just make themselves. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. All those little son of a guns.

In life you need colors. Don't fight it, use what happens. I'm a water fanatic. I love water. Now we don't want him to get lonely, so we'll give him a little friend. There comes a nice little fluffer. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain.

Here's another little happy bush There it is. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.
